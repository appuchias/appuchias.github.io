## Car Report

Car report is an app I found around 2 years ago in [F-droid](https://f-droid.org/).
It is a simple app that helps you track your car expenses.

It had an old UI but it had many features and it was really easy to use.

I was really happy with the app, so I decided to investigate the app and found out that it was unmaintained since 2019 (officially since 2021).

That wasn't a problem, as the app works and it doesn't depend on any service that could be shut down, so it shouldn't stop working anytime soon.

I now store all the refuelings, services and other expenses of 2 cars in the app, and back it up regularly to keep the data safe.

## What happened?

The real reason I'm writing this post is that I found out that the app was removed from F-droid.

I use [Obtainium](https://obtainium.org/) to manage all the apps I install from outside the official store,
and I received a notification saying that the latest version of the app could not be found.

I checked [the app in F-droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.kuehle.carreport/) and all I saw was a message saying that the app was not found.
But the [metadata](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/me.kuehle.carreport.yml) was still there.

Checking on the [F-droid blog](https://f-droid.org/en/2024/09/19/twif.html) I found that they had archived more than 300 outdated, broken or unmaintained apps from the store.
(I just found out that they're still available in the archive repo, so this post is not that useful, but I'll keep it here for the record)

Luckily the site was archived in the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20240105141312/https://f-droid.org/en/packages/me.kuehle.carreport/), so the APK isn't lost.[^1]
[^1]: 2024-12-17 I later discovered that F-droid has an archive and the APK is still there, but this was already written, so it will stay here

Anyways,

## The APK

I now have the APK available in these files: [Car Report 3.25.0 (79)](/files/me.kuehle.carreport_79.apk)
