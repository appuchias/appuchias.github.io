## The first post

It is always difficult to start something new: new habits, a new job or maybe a new relationship. But I hope that this blog I'm deciding to start writing on from today once becomes a reference page for someone's projects, inspiration or entertainment. I hope this becomes useful for someone that just wants to get answers that happen to be here, quickly.

I don't have many things to say yet, I don't have a clear path to follow nor I want one. I intend to write about the projects I develop over the time and how I am succesful or not.

You can check out my currently running projects on my website, where I will try to add this blog.

Thanks for being here :)
