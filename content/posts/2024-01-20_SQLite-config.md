This post covers some settings I have discovered about SQLite these days that
help it perform better without losing consistency.

The official reference and the sources of my discoveries will be listed in the
[References]({{< ref "#references" >}}) section below.

This will be a short one, mainly to help future me, but also for anyone planning
to use SQLite in production (including me).

# Configuring SQLite

A few days ago I thought SQLite didn't need any configuration but oh boy was I 
wrong.

To configure SQLite you use the `PRAGMA` command in the DB:

- You can query the current `value` of a `setting`, with `PRAGMA setting;`
- Or set a new `value`, using `PRAGMA setting=value;`

# The tips

A one-liner with all settings will be [at the end]({{< ref "#one-liner" >}}).
> ## Journal mode
>
> `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;`
>
> This changes the default journaling mode fron DELETE to WAL (Write-Ahead Log)
> which allows reading from the DB while also writing to it as one of its
> features.
>
> This feature can be used with SQLite 3.7.0 (2010-07-21) or later.
>
> [Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_journal_mode)

> ## Synchronous
>
> `PRAGMA synchronous=1;`
>
> The default value of 2 (FULL) is not needed if WAL is enabled, and changing it
> to 1 (NORMAL) improves speed while not losing safety.
>
> [Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_synchronous)

> ## Busy timeout
>
> `PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000;`
>
> This sets the time write transactions will wait to start at maximum (in ms).
> If unset, they would fail immediately if the database is locked.
>
> [Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_busy_timeout)

> ## Foreign keys
>
> `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;`
>
> SQLite does not enforce FKs by default, so this enables its enforcement as
> it's highly recommended.
>
> Please use foreign keys.
> 
> [Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_foreign_keys)

## One-liner

For a database stored in `db.sqlite3`:

```shell
sqlite3 db.sqlite3 "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL; PRAGMA synchronous=1; PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000; PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;"
```
