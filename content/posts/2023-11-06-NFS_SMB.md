Creating a NFS share is quite easy, and it's a fast way to share files between Linux hosts, and apparently even with recent Windows machines (untested).

Samba (SMB) is the native way to do it in Windows, but comes with some more overhead which reduces its file transfer speeds (untested).

# NFS

## Required packages

The required packages are the following:
```bash
# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S nfs-utils

# Debian and derivatives (Ubuntu, etc.)
sudo apt install nfs-kernel-server
```

## Share creation

After choosing the folder you want to share, you'll need to define the shared folders inside the `/etc/exports` file (created after the package installation).

The format required for the shares defined in that file is the following:
```sh
/path/to/folder hostname1(options1) hostname2(options2) [others]
```

- The `/path/to/folder` needs to exist in your filesystem.
- `hostname1` can be either a hostname (`example.com`), an IP address (`192.168.1.3`) or a subnet address in CIDR (`10.0.0.0/8`).
- The `options` available can be found [here](https://man.archlinux.org/man/exports.5#General_Options).

After declaring the shares, you can start sharing with the following command:
```bash
exportfs -var
```

It will re-export all entries in `/etc/exports` and it will output al the changes made.

## As a client

After installing the corresponding package (`nfs-utils` for Arch Linux or `nfs-common` for Debian and derivatives), you can see the exports available from a server with `sudo showmount -e server-hostname` (the hostname can be an IP address), and then mount a share using:

```bash
sudo mount server-hostname:/path/to/share /path/to/local/folder
```
