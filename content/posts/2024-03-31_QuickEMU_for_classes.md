I recently had to install some software in my computer that I knew would mess
with system libraries and give me some trouble in the future, so it occurred to
me that using a VM and connecting to it through the VSCode SSH Tunnel extension
to write the code I needed could be a great alternative to installing it directly
and it wouldn't break anythin in my OS.

# Introduction

## My current setup

This is a bit of a disclaimer of sorts.

My Linux distro of choice is Arch.
I've been using it for some years now and I'm
pleased with it.

This post covers my setup, using VSCode (for in-class simultaneous editing), the fish shell and Arch Linux.
If you're running any other setup, you'll need to adapt some aspects to how you do things.

## What is QuickEMU

[QuickEMU](https://github.com/quickemu-project/quickemu) is a really quick way to create VMs of any OS using QEMU and KVM.

For installation instructions, go to the project's homepage.

After you have it installed, you can use it as easy as:
```shell
quickget <OS/Distro> <version> <variant>
```

and

```shell
quickemu --vm <.conf file>
```

You can reference both commands' options using `--help`.

## What I needed

I needed to install Julia, but not only Julia.

I needed some libraries, including Flux and Scikit-Learn.

This will explain some things that happen after

# The idea

## Creating an Arch Linux VM

To do this, just run `quickget archlinux latest` and then
`quickemu --vm archlinux-latest.conf` in that same folder.

That will download the ISO and run the VM for the first time.
The `quickemu` command will also print all the info you might need to connect to
the running VM in case you accidentally close the SPICE connection that will start.

To use a better SPICE client, simply add `--display=spice`.
This will launch a different app to view the VM's screen output.
To release the mouse and keyboard from this app, you'll need to press `SHIFT+F12`.

### Installation

It'll be better if you use Arch installed rather than the live ISO, so once you
boot the VM for the first time, install it as you normally would (`archinstall`
comes handy).

My recommendations for archinstall are:

- Use a best-effort partitioning for your disks with ext4
- Use systemd-boot
- No swap
- Create a sudo user (apart from root)
- Profile: Minimal
- No audio server
- `linux` kernel
- Add the vim, git and base-devel packages
- Copy the ISO network config
- Add the multilib repo if you think you'll need it

However, feel free to install it as you please.

After installation, don't chroot and run `poweroff`.

Then, start back the VM with the same display mode and log in as your user before continuing.

## SSH-ing easily

To use SSH, you'll need to install the `openssh` package with `sudo pacman -S openssh`
After installation, enable it and start it with `sudo systemctl enable --now sshd`

QuickEMU automatically redirects your guest's port 22 to your host's port 22220,
so, to SSH into the VM you can run `ssh user@localhost -p 22220`.

For a more permanent solution, I added the following to my `~/.ssh/config`:
```shell
QuickVM
    HostName localhost
    Port 22220
    User user
```

Having this config makes connecting to the VM as easy as `ssh QuickVM`

But there's a catch.
If you start another VM after this one (not simultaneously), you won't be able
to connect to it immediately, as the guest VM SSH keys will be different and
OpenSSH will reasonably complain to protect you from a [MITM attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).

To remove the notice (DO IT ONLY IF YOU'RE SURE IT MAY HAVE CHANGED, WORRY OTHERWISE)
run `ssh-keygen -R [localhost]:22220`.
